                    <p>This advanced hierarchical Bayesian framework uses R to model individual pitcher aging trajectories and detect performance decline, processing 10+ years of Statcast data to provide front offices with injury risk assessments and workload management insights.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Phase 1:</b> Architected hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate age curves for velocity, movement, and command metrics across pitcher populations. Established decline patterns and individual risk assessments using 10+ years of Statcast data with uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Phase 2:</b> Implemented changepoint detection algorithms to identify precise decline onset timing with statistical confidence intervals. System distinguishes between natural aging, mechanical degradation, and injury-related performance changes</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Phase 3:</b> Developed real-time posterior updating system incorporating new performance data to continuously refine decline probability estimates.
