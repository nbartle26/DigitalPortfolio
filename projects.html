                    <p style="color: red;">IN PROGRESS</p> 
                    <p>This intensive project leverages Python, SQL, and Tableau to construct and analyze ESG scores for S&P 500 companies, structured into 3 main phases that progressively increase automation, depth, and decision value.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Phase 1:</b> Integrated existing ESG datasets by scraping preset scores from Yahoo Finance (Sustainalytics) and MSCI. Established a clean SQL database foundation with company metadata, sector/industry classifications, and baseline E/S/G pillar scores.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Phase 2:</b> Built an automated AI/ML web scraping pipeline to extract ESG-related KPIs and controversy events from corporate filings, sustainability reports, and news. Applied natural language processing to map disclosures to MSCI’s 33 key issues, and implemented machine learning models in Python to compute Sustainalytics-style risk metrics (exposure, management, unmanaged risk) with configurable materiality weights at the sector, industry, and sub-industry levels.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Phase 3:</b> Developed interactive Tableau dashboards to translate ESG risk into actionable insights. Visualizations include peer benchmarking, sector-level heatmaps, time-series trendlines, and drill-downs into material issues and controversies—allowing stakeholders to effectively evaluate ESG risks, identify high-exposure firms, and support strategic decision-making.</p>

            <p style="color: red;">IN PROGRESS</p>                         <p>This project demonstrates full-stack web development skills by building a modern, responsive service business website with interactive features. On the frontend, I utilized HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and mobile-friendly user interface, including a dynamic online appointment booking system, a real-time search bar, and a custom quote calculator. Accessibility and user experience were prioritized through semantic markup, ARIA roles, and responsive design techniques, ensuring the site performs seamlessly across devices.</p>

                <p style="color: red;"></p>  
                <p>A comprehensive pitcher evaluation framework that uses stacking into a unified Stuff+ metric. Built using ensemble stacking methods in R, this system combines multiple XGBoost models with weighted aggregation to produce a single, holistic assessment of pitch quality. The model accounts for pitch characteristics and movement to generate grades that predict pitcher performance independent of outcomes. Includes validation against existing industry metrics and generates pitcher rankings with confidence intervals.</p>

The pipeline involves data preprocessing and filtering, feature engineering, model training with cross-validation, performance and accuracy evaluation (ROC-AUC calculations), feature importance and correlation plots analysis, and pitcher leaderboard table creation. I also developed a interactive Shiny App calculator for real-time metric calculation for pitchers on their pitch characteristics to predict expected groundball rates. The plots help determine which model features are significant in influencing a GB outcome, and the final leaderboard compares actual vs. expected GB rates and identifies over/under-performers relative to their pitch characteristics.</p>

Feature importance and correlation plots help determine which model features play the most significant role in influencing swing and miss outcomes. I also developed a interactive Shiny App calculator for real-time metric calculation for pitchers on their pitch characteristics to predict expected whiff rates.

                <p>An advanced hierarchical Bayesian model built in R that estimates age curves for pitcher performance while simultaneously detecting individual changepoints indicating decline or injury impact. Uses MCMC sampling to model player-specific trajectories with population-level priors, allowing the system to identify when pitchers deviate from expected aging patterns. Incorporates changepoint detection algorithms to flag potential injury or skill degradation events, providing probabilistic estimates of decline timing. Visualizations include posterior distributions, credible intervals, and player-specific aging curves with identified inflection points.</p>

            <p>
                This project was a personal favorite, diving into offensive metrics for the 2024 Yankee Season. A custom Python codebase creates a Dash site with multiple data visualizations comparing hitters' actual performance to expected metrics. Built to help determine if hitters were underperforming or just unlucky.

                <p style="color: red;">IN PROGRESS</p>                <p>A Python-focused codebase that scrapes, manipulates, and formats baseball data with the goal to visualize offensive performance in the strikezone. This visual details hot/cold zones of the hitter, their actual and expected statistics, performances vs specific pitch types, splits righty-lefty and lefty/right, and much more. </p> <br>
                <p>This project utilized Pandas for robust data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation of Statcast data, including dynamic zone assignment based on pitch location. Engineered a custom strike zone mapping function to classify pitch locations into 9 standard zones and out-of-zone regions using conditional logic and coordinate binning. Built a Dash web application with interactive components, including a dropdown menu and responsive Plotly visualizations based on user input. Designed custom Plotly strike zone visualizations, integrating statistical overlays (AVG and xAVG) and dynamically adjusting label placement for clarity and comparison. Implemented real-time callback functions to update figures based on player selection, enabling exploratory analysis of offensive performance by zone. </p>
